Like the sting of a bee,<br>
that never goes away.<br>
No antidote for it,<br>
"just breathe" is all they say.

I am not sick,<br>
nor ecstatic as I play.<br>
Yet my heart shrinks<br>
when facing a new tray.

"Don't dwell too much on it,"<br>
my therapist would say.<br>
The more attention it receives<br>
the bigger it becomes, I bet.

I guess I'll live with it,<br>
an invitation to the game.<br>
Teaming up,<br>
to see how far we'll get.
