She drank the whiskey,<br>
I chose the water;<br>
yet I still got tipsy<br>
staring at the girl with an absent father.

No liquor have I ever<br>
drank to feel this way<br>
and it may not last forever,<br>
for I'm just another prey.

"It's time for y'all to leave,"<br>
the bartender loudly screamed.<br>
The bar will close at 3.<br>
It's time to stop this dream.

No words that I could speak<br>
to the greatest of all thieves,<br>
for stealing all the self-worth<br>
that any man deserves to keep.
